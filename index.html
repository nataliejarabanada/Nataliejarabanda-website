        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Natalie Jarabanda and I am a first-year psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. However, I am originally from Los Angeles. I hope to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology before going to graduate school for social psychology. My career goals include conducting research in social-cultural psychology to further the knowledge base about human behavior as it relates to our culture and surroundings. I have always been very interested in the reasons why us humans behave and think the way that we do. Next quarter, I am going to join UCR's Psychology Honor Society to meet more like-minded students within the field and to gain research experience here on campus and to be more involved in general. <br><br>

        I feel that I am a very passionate and determined student when it comes to my education and I hope this is portrayed through the various work projects I have done. For example, I interned at Children's Hospital Los Angeles for their brain imaging lab for a Concussion Study. It was associated with my high schools football teams and I was a great asset to the main researchers in inputing data and keeping the players in check. I also volunteered at USC Verdugo Hills hospital for a year in highschool where I managed front desk by answering phone calls, directed more than 50 visitors a day and handed out visitor passes, as well as discharging patients including elders and new mothers. I also volunteered at Mountain Avenue Elementary's Science Club where I oversaw up to 100 4th-6th grade students during presentations and assisted them with science activities, willingly advised and offered my knowledge to students about school and life in general and also gave a 20 minute presentation about the brain and concussions and designed an activity to teach students the importance of wearing a helmet. 
 <br><br>

        Aside from my professional career, a few other activities I enjoy are hanging out with my friends, playing tennis, reading, watching movies and overall just trying new things. Even though I was born in Los Angeles, my family is from Syria so I can speak fluent Arabic and I'm very in touch with my Middle Eastern roots, including the food and the music. Many people know me for my kind heart and sarcastic nature, I love making jokes when its appropriate and seeing others laughing and being happy. I very much enjoy listening to and discovering new music with my friends and dancing around just having a good time. I love all kinds of foods, especially my mothers Arab food, which I often miss while I'm at school. Furthermore, I love fashion and clothes and makeup and trying new trends and creating new styles with various colors and patterns and textures, mainly during the winter. Over the summer I plan to do an internship for a psychology lab to gain more experience with research and find out if I truly like social-cultural research or if there is another field of psychology that I enjoy more.
